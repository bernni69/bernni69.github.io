    <h1>What devices can you play on?</h1>
    <p>In the chapter 2 season 8 there are many devices to play Fortnite on. There has recenly been some trouble with epicgames and apple, that why now on app store or any mobile devices Fortnite has been baned ever since the argument. Fortnite can now only be played on ps4 or ps5, Nintendo switch, Pc and Xbox. Many times Fortnite updates will cost a lot of GB(gigabytes). Sometimes your device will be allowed to update which is good. But sometimes you will have to buy more memory for the hardware.</p>

    <h1>popularity</h1>
    
    <p> The majority of people playing fortnite these days are 4.8 million people. Fortnite lately lost a lot of people who play their game because of the new update and lost a lot of money. After chapter 2 came out 350 million people started to hate the game amd stared to uninstall the game because it became less fun for all the players tryimg to play it. Since new players are getting better and are starting to become pro players. Now the people to quit hate on fortnite because the eneies were to good. People who are still playing fortnite still love it and defend it. Many pro players have accually been speaking why people rage and quit the game. They only quit and rage because they dont stay in ceative sweating and building in your map putting all the practices nd your skills to the test the only played solos doing nothing but pushing eneis so then they die. After that happens the people just rage quit and give up and then they start to hate on the game. I understand some people quit the game because it was dying but dont hate on the game it a great game and i think it time for you try it out.</p>
